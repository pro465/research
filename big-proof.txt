let max(t) be the maximum of all the labels in the tree t, and app(t) be the number of its appearances in the tree.
let root(t) be the label at the root of the tree t.

we'll also say "halts" to mean "goes to some tree t with max(t) = 0 under this process".

lemma 1: let all trees t with max(t) < n halt, then all trees t with max(t)=n also halt.
proof:
base case: let there be a tree t with only root(t)=max(t) (app(t) = 1). 
    then its child subtrees have max < n, which halt by the assumption.
    each reset also only sets labels to be < n, resulting in them still halting after resets.
inductive case:
    let all trees t with max(t)<n, or max(t)=n and app(t)<k halt, 
    and let there be a tree t with max(t)=n, app(t)=k and root(t)=max(t).
    then its child subtrees have app < k and max <= n, which halt by the inductive hypothesis.
    each reset also only sets labels to be < n, resulting in them still halting after resets.
