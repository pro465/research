The author is pretty sure it's TC.

Proof sketch:
Take an arbitrary MM with {INC, CMPJMP} as its base, where the CMPJMP command takes two targets, one for when it is equal, and one for when it's not.

Next, take all the jumps' targets. divide the program into contiguous blocks which start with one target location and end with the next.
