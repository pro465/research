1+1=2
2+1=3
3+3=6
6+6=12
12+3=15
hence m(15) = 5

m(1)=0
m(2)=1
m(3)=2
m(4)=2
m(5)=3
m(6)=3
m(7)=4
m(8)=3
m(9)=4

we want to minimize the cardinality of the set S_n, where S_n:
1. is a finite subset of N,
2. contains 1 and n,
3. for its every element c \neq 1, there exist (not necessarily distinct) elements a and b s.t. a+b=c.

in case of 15, that set is {1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 15}.
