# Graph isomorphism
2^(n*(n-1)/2) possible graphs from n vertices.
hence 2^(n*(n-1)/2) - nu(n) unique graphs, where nu(n) = non-unique graphs.
number isomorphic graphs for a given graph = number of unique permutations.
encoding - 
  prime numbers
    - does not seem to work, idk why
        - now know: too complex to sort
  only count non-swappable vertices
