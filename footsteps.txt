# turing completeness proof notes

- problem: dont know how to skip
- empty lines may help
  - or may not. might just make it eqv. to PDA.
- partial/possible solution #1: somehow decide what would be skipped at time of copying instead of after.
  - not possible. need data.
- possible sol #2: cicdcicdcicd... where c is copy next or empty line, i is instruction, d is data.
  - recursive definition of 0 data
    - may be fixed by using end.
